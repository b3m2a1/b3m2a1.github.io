# What Do People Want To Build?

Over the past year and a bit I've developed quite a bit of infrastructure from  [a documentation platform](https://b3m2a1.github.io/simplifying-mathematica-documentation.html) to a  [website builder ](tps:/b3m2a1.github.io/making-a-blog-in-30-minutes.html) and  [package repository](https://paclets.github.io/PacletServer/) all extending and using  [my existing toolkit](https://github.com/b3m2a1/mathematica-BTools) . Recently, though I've wondered what I can do to make this  *useful* .

Obviously, there are little bugs to quash, little things to extend and build, but I think for many things the infrastructure I have can be useful and make the development process a lot quicker and cleaner. So I'm putting out a request.

What do you want to build and what tools would make that easier? What kind of blockages have you run into when trying to get stuff developed? Leave me notes in the comments and I'll try to figure out what kinds of things I can/should document to make this better for everyone.
