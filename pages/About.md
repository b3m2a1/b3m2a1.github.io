I'm a fly-by-night programmer and sorta-scientist. 

I like projects that critics rave "will never be completed, never be used, and never be seen" and about which my many friends and admirers say "why are you doing this?", "literally this is so dumb", and "there's something wrong with you"

Most things I build using Mathematica and python, like  [this site](https://www.wolframcloud.com/objects/b3m2a1/home/main.html), a few [other](https://www.wolframcloud.com/objects/b3m2a1.paclets/PacletServer/main.html)   [sites](https://www.wolframcloud.com/objects/b3m2a1.docs/main.html), a  [framework for building Pokemon games](https://github.com/b3m2a1/python-fauxkemon), a  [chemistry modeling package](https://github.com/b3m2a1/mathematica-ChemTools), a  [link between Mathematica and python](https://github.com/b3m2a1/mathematica-PyTools), and a  [slew of other little utilities](https://github.com/b3m2a1/mathematica-tools).

I also enjoy 3D modelling with  [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/), ABMs in  [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) , and learning about  [math-centric programming languages](https://github.com/tlaplus).
